# Alfred-workflow-create-link-to-file
Create a link to a selected file

# Introduction

This workflow creates a simple link (or, optionally, if you choose that in the workflow configuration, a markdown link) to a file selected in Finder so that you can paste the link into some other app from which you wish to link to the file. If there are spaces in the file path or filename they will be appropriately encoded.

# Usage

Use your [Universal Action](https://www.alfredapp.com/help/features/universal-actions/) hotkey to select a file in Finder then start typing `Create link to file` in the search field and once that is selected press <kbd>⏎</kbd>.

If, in the workflow configuration, you have chosen to create markdown links you will be prompted for the name of the link (with the file name filled in as a default—simply delete that and type anything you want as an alternative).
